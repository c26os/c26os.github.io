I don't totally understand what I'm doing yet, but sitting down for an hour and focusing on this has been a great help in itself. So far I've coded the basics; a title, a menu with hrefs, and this journal page. I'm excited to continue updating this digital journal with my progress and see it grow!</p></div></section>

				What is an event listener? What is an event? How do you get "into" console.log and the different "attributes" of an Event? An event listener is ()
